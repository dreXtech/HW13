<p>What is student life?</p>
Student life revolves around the things students do outside of being in class 
whether on or off campus. The student life center has information and programs 
to help students to be involved in sports, academic clubs, entertainment, and 
community action. Students are in need of many and may not know where to 
find such services. The staff at the student life center will make every effort 
to meet your needs.
